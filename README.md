# Client-Server-Chat-Messenger
This project is a Single Client and Server "Chat Messenger" developed using Python Sockets and Tkinter,
It is connection oriented (i.e. it uses TCP) and works in the following way:

1) The Server runs first and waits for some client to contact it.
2) Client Program starts and connects to the server.
3) Client-Server sends and receives messages.

For execution of code directly run server_gui.py file on one command prompt and client_gui.py on other cmd.
